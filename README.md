### Web Application Security: Threats and Mitigation Strategies
In recent years, businesses have increasingly adopted the web as a cost-effective platform for sharing and exchanging data with prospects and customers. Web applications have become integral to streamlining operations and enhancing user experiences, offering a wide range of functionalities to clients. However, the reliance on web applications has also introduced significant security challenges, particularly due to the transmission of sensitive information during interactions.

Despite their advantages, web applications are often vulnerable to attacks due to coding errors or loopholes. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to databases and compromise sensitive information. This document explores various types of web application attacks, their potential impacts, and effective remedies to mitigate these threats.

Additionally, we discuss strategies for safeguarding organizational resources by securing applications that may contain exploitable code. We also highlight the tools and practices that can be employed to proactively prevent attacks and ensure a secure operational environment.
